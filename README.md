# AgeCalc
AgeCalc is a python program which can precisely calculate your age based on your birth year, month, and day input.

It is incredibly simple, easy, and efortless to use.

A short explanation is given for any errors you might encounter, as well as a suggestion on how to correct your input.

It has also been modified to work inside a discord bot, but more features regarding that will be made to ensure a more user-friendly interaction with the bot.
The bot edition will have many more minor features to make it more diverse and engaging. Some of those features include but are not limited to:

* Help command (bot) - a command which will list all the available bot commands and briefly explain how to properly apply and use them. ✓

* Reverse age calculator system (bot) - a program which will enable the user to enter how old they are in years, months, and days and have the program reveal 
their birthdate.

* Minor check (bot) - a program which will print out whether the user is a minor or not based on their age, and in accordance to that enable or disable their
ability to see specific channels.

~ Do not use this as a definitive measure of whether a user is underage or not. ~

* Under 13 check (bot) - a program which will either lock out, kick or soft ban users that are under 13 according to their age calculation.

~ Do not use this as a definitive measure of whether a user is under 13 or not. ~
